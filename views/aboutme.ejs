                        I started liking web technologies back from my collge days when I entered in IT field. I still remember that thrill when I first establish connection between ASP page and MS-ACCESS in 2001.

                <p>
                    I have completed Diploma in 2003 whereas occupied Bachelor degree in 2006.  At that point only one thought in my mind was to dive in the ocean of Front End technologies.

                    Since then, I have worked many multi-national companies and projects. And for that reason, I have wide specture of knowlege in Front End based technologies and User Experience fundamentals.

                    I have crossed distance from Trainee Engineer to Track Leader. But still I consider myself as part of BIG team - team of Front End Developers who everyday dive into this ocean to discover yet another pearl.
