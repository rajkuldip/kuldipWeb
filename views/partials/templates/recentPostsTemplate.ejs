						<span>There are several tabs related plugin available. But when it comes to responsive, we left with only few options. We needed in different forms in different occassion; in dropdown form, in carousel form or in accordian form. Recently while working on one of such kind of project requirement, I found out other developer had used seperate plugins for tabs and carousel. Therefore, I have created kind of plugin for tabs which gets covert into either of these options. Simple Stuff, Simple plug-in.</span>
